# Tamagometer Companion
Use your Flipper as an IR bridge to talk to Tamagotchi Connection (2024)!

## Usage
Plug your Flipper into a computer with the USB cable, and open the Tamagometer Companion App.

On the computer, open the tamagometer web app (Github: https://github.com/zacharesmer/tamagometer Link: https://zacharesmer.github.io/tamagometer/).

If you have two tamagotchis, record some interactions, save them, and play them back. If you just have one, try some of the interactions in the "Starter Pack".
